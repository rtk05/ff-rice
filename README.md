## FF-Rice

This is a modified version of ProMcTagonist's ff-rice that I have tweaked a little over the years. ff-rice overhauls the top bar of firefox to give it a clean and compact look.

## Installation

* Copy the contents of rice to a new stylish style
* Works best with classic theme restorer and simple white X theme

## Credits
Thanks to ProMcTagonist for the original
